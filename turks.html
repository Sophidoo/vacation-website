                <h1>Turks and Caicos Islands</h1>
                <p>Our love affair with Turks & Caicos began long ago (over 20 years past). Not only is this the place where Angie married Adam, but it has become a frequent vacation spot shared with their children, extended family, and closest friends. Our busy lives are put on hold when we commit ourselves to a week in Providenciales (“Provo”), the most famous of the 100 islands and cays of the Turks & Caicos. <br><br>

                Family travelers will enjoy meandering and strolling beautiful Grace Bay Beach, named the #1 beach in the world based on Travelers' Choice, and holds the #2 spot on Trip Advisor's best beaches in the world list. With the most crystal blue waters, your family will spend much time swimming and enjoying marina life. <br> <br>
                    
                BTA encourages you to take an excursion or two into the waters. Half-day and full-day excursions with the options of sailing, scuba, snorkeling, water sporting, fishing, and island hopping are available from our excellent partners. <br> <br>
                    
                During your time at sea, you will not want to miss a visit to Little Water Cay (Iguana Island). Due in part to extensive conservative efforts, the endangered Turks and Caicos Rock Iguanas (Cyclura carinata) are everywhere on the island. <br> <br>
                    
                The warmth of the sea and its calm waves will have even the most hesitant swimmers and mild seasickness sufferers finding themselves exploring these waters. An evening sail on a catamaran is a perfect way to enjoy one of the most breathtaking sunsets you will ever see. The local population is very welcoming to tourists. Embrace the culture by attending the Island Fish Fry every Thursday from 5:30 pm to 9:30 pm at the Bight (Children's) Park. This cultural explosion includes over a dozen local food vendors, entertainers, and cultural acts come together for an evening of “all things TCI.” You may even run into special guest DJ Shaquille O'Neil as we did. <br><br>
