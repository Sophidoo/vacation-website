                <h1>Costa Rica</h1>
                <p>A time-tested, family favorite, this country stole our hearts on our very first visit and has kept us coming back year after year. <br> <br>

                There are towering mountains, active volcanos, flowing hot springs, seemingly impenetrable rain forests, world-class rapids, and thousands of miles of coastline for snorkeling for adventure seekers and families with school-age and teen children scuba diving, surfing, and boogie boarding. <br> <br>
                
                There are unspoiled and often empty beaches for families with younger children, friendly and welcoming locals, beautiful and easily accessible hotels and eco-lodges, aromatic coffee plantations, hundreds of yoga shalas, and lazy days at the pool. Although this small but mighty country can take several lifetimes to explore, a 7-10 day itinerary can certainly scratch the surface… but we will warn you that once you’ve sampled the Pure Vida lifestyle, you may never want to leave. 
                <p> <br>
                <b>When to go:</b>  December-March is peak season on the Pacific coast with gorgeous sunny days and high prices. June-November is considered green with afternoon showers, lower costs, and lush landscapes. July is regarded as the veranillo (“little summer”), so prices in many areas increase.. <br> <br>
