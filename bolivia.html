                <h1>Bolivia</h1>
                <p>Bolivia may not be on your top 5, top 10, or top anything list of travel. Still, the country is a gold mine for adventures, nature, delicious cuisine, life-changing experiences, and ecotourism. The hemisphere’s highest, most isolated, and most off-the-beaten-path country. Local tour groups have proliferated, with many offering hikes along the Inca Trails, gliding on remote jungle rivers, or viewing the nesting grounds of hundreds of species of tropical birds. <br> <br>

                From the crimson Laguna Colorada where thousands of James’ flamingos gather as though awaiting your arrival, to the incredible rock formations that rise out of the desert and finally to the salt flats, which are an iconic main attraction, this dream-like landscape will leave you speechless and amazed. And while the young ones are easier to impress, EVEN your teenagers may pose for a selfie because this landscape is definitely worth an Instagram Brag!</p>
