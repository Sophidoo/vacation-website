                <h1>Spain</h1>
                <p>This is another place that stole our hearts and had us daydreaming of buying a one-way ticket and never turning back. Spain is a large and diverse country, comprised of 17 Autonomous Regions, each with its unique culture, language, customs, and cuisine. <br> <br>

                From the Gaudi and Dali infused region of Catalonia, to the white villages, vibrant cities, and historic charms of Andalusia, to the world food capital of the Basque region’s city of San Sebastian to the manicured gardens and world-famous social scene of the Costa Del Sol and  Marbella our month in Spain barely scratched the surface. So whether your family is interested in history, relaxation, cuisine, art, or outdoor exploration, there are medieval villages, stunning beaches, and delicious food to fit every taste. <br><br>
                    
                The Game of Thrones filming locations may add an entirely new and exciting element to families traveling with teenagers to your family vacation. Some of the famous scenes were shot in Castell de Santa Florentina in the town of Canet de Mar, The Castle of Zafra in Guadalajara, the bullring of the Andalusian town of Osuna, the Alcazar of Seville and Cordoba’s Roman Bridge. <br> <br>
                    
                Spain is also extremely child friendly, and although many families may be initially taken aback by the midday siestas, late dinners, and relaxed bedtimes, the celebration of families and unhurried pace of life will quickly have you settled in</p>
                <p> <br>
                <b>When to go:</b>  Much of the country enjoys a temperate and mild climate, although Southern Spain does have hot summers. June-August is the busiest tourist season with children off school and many Europeans taking a month off, flocking to beaches to enjoy family time. <br> <br>
